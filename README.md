# SQL Query Generator and Natural Language Responder
This project is an interactive Streamlit application that simplifies SQL query generation and response interpretation. Users can input natural language questions about a database, and the application generates an appropriate SQL query, retrieves the query results, and provides a natural language response based on the data.
The app leverages LangChain and Google's Generative AI API to create a smooth and user-friendly experience for interacting with complex databases.
